<h1>Portfolio-Challenge-2</h2>

<strong><h1>Description</h2></strong>

<p>For the Portfolio Challenge for module 2, I created the page using HTML and CSS to show case what was learned during Module 2. I had to create the this page from scratch since no code was provided for us to work with. Some of the topics I used to create this web page are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Flexbox: Used to "box" the elements in order for elements to be arragned and displayed.</li>
  <li>Responsive Design: Used for the application to be displayed proportionally if its viewed on mobile or tablet devices</li>
  <li>Resets: In order to see how the web page would look like without CSS</li>
  <li>Typography: Used to have a different font other than the browser's default</li>
  <li>Pseudo Classes: Used to specify a special state of a selected element or elements </li>
  <li>Pseudo Elements: Used to specify a special state of a selected element or elements</li>
  <li>Wireframing: Used as a draft in order to have an idea of how the web pabe should look like</li>
  <li>CSS Selectors: Used to identify a certain element inside the web page to provide a style</li>
  <li>CSS Variables: Used to specify certain parts of the web page and provide format</li>
</ol>

<strong><h2>What did I learn?</strong></h2>

<p>During this challenge I learned to use CSS a bit more, specially the media query to make web pages responsive. Nowadays, people use cell phones more and more, so its interesting how to make web pages and apps responsive to ensure the functionality is still kept.</p>
